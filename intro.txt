Time Complexity of Priority Queue for:

-> insertion = O(logN)
-> pop       = O(logN)
-> get       = O(logN)

What is a HEAP??

-> Binary tree 
-> Complete binary tree property (CBT)
   ~ each node has a left and right child, only the leaf nodes can have one child, but in left to right direction 
     , any hole in middle, then that tree will not be considered a heap.
   ~ Examples: 
                     1                                          1
                2         3                                2          3
            4       _ 6       7                         4      5  6        7
            NOT a HEAP(because there is                 this is a HEAP
                        a gap after 4.)
-> Heap Order property
   ~ Max Heap 
    - Parent > Children
   ~ Min Heap
    - Parent < Children

Any complete binary tree can be stored in the form an array. With the parent at 'i' index and left child at '2i'
and right child at '2i+1'.

Since the time complexity for inserting elements in the last in an array is O(1), therefore we will visualize heap 
in the form of a tree, but execute in the form of an array.
